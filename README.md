I decided to increase my web development skills. The internet isn't going away anyways.

I've tried different content management systems on the internet and I almost don’t know what to do here. Social media is exhausting. Video fatigue is real.


I wouldn’t complain about staying at home all the time during a global pandemic if the internet wasn’t as privatized as it is today. Remember when we could flex their basic html coding muscles on social media platforms, update free blogs, create open sourced wiki pages, and get cheap domain name registrations without being forced to buy a content management system that doesn’t even give you access to the backend? Now if you want to create something, internet spaces are expensive and physical spaces are prohibitively so. What can we do?

I’ve used all the web content editors and content management systems on the internet and at this point in time and space none of them feel quite right. I don't feel like I am able to truly express myself when I use wordpress or godaddy or squarespace or wix or any other of the privatized platforms that we have today in the <b>world wide web</b>. I don't feel like any of it conveys all that I have to say. So we’re going back to the basics. <b6>HTML basics</b>, that is. Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEH2fk0ONag">Hamster Dance</a>? That was peak internet. My mission is to create a website that is fun!
