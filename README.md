# hello-world

My name is Julia. I'm a writer. Though I am <b>not</b> a web developer, I would like to learn more about building websites as a hobby. I'm also new to GitHub. Please excuse the code errors.

As I learn more coding languages and systems, I am going to write on the subject of technology we used in the 90s. When I need lorem ipsum text, I am going to write about the music I listened to in the 90s on my portable CD player or about what was the best Lipsmacker flavor and why. I was searching for a democratic web host a place where you can edit the back end and use your own code. A lot has changed since everyone's writing code for mobile devices, but I'm still nostalgic for Geocities. That's what lead me to GitHub, and I look forward to learning more!

I'm using [Atom](https://atom.io) as a text editor.
