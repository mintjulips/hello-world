# hello-world

My name is Julia. I'm a writer. I am <b>not</b> a web developer. I would like to learn more about building websites. I'm also new to GitHub. Please excuse the code errors.

As I learn more coding languages and systems, I am going to write on the subject of technology we used in 1999. Usually I like to play around in Tumblr because that is the last free democratic web host where you can edit the back end and use your own code. You can view an example (https://bekindandrewindto1999.tumblr.com) but I must warn you that you may only be able to view it on a computer and on certain browsers. A lot has changed since everyone's writing code for mobile devices, but I'm still nostalgic for Geocities.
