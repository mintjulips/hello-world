## _This space is an experiment_

I decided to increase my web development skills. The internet isn't going away anyways.

<I've tried different content management systems on the internet and I almost don’t know what to do here. Social media is exhausting. I’ve used all the web content editors and content management systems on the internet and at this point in time and space none of them feel quite right. I don't feel like I am able to truly express myself when I use wordpress or godaddy or squarespace or wix or any other privatized platforms that we have today in the <b>world wide web</b>. I don't feel like any of it conveys all that I have to say. So we’re going back to the basics. <b6>HTML basics</b>, that is. Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEH2fk0ONag">Hamster Dance</a>? That was peak internet.
