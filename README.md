# hello-world

My name is Julia. I'm a writer. I am <b>not</b> a web developer. I would like to learn more about building websites as a hobby. I'm also new to GitHub. Please excuse the code errors.

As I learn more coding languages and systems, I am going to write on the subject of technology we used in 1999, just to use something. Currently I'm searching for a democratic web host a place where you can edit the back end and use your own code. A lot has changed since everyone's writing code for mobile devices, but I'm still nostalgic for Geocities. GitHub sounds fun to learn.
