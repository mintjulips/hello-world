*How do you write a Livejournal in the year 2020?*

I am using Git Hub to practice my web development skills. It seems the internet isn't going away anyways.

Something that I've been thinking about recently, as a writer, is how I feel I've exhausted the content management systems on the internet and how it's difficult to find the right one. Then you have web hosting which has become virtual real estate and prohibitively expensive as such. I feel trapped in a social media loop. Video fatigue is real.


Now that we are trying to practice social distancing to the best of our abilities in a global pandemic, it feels disheartening to log into the internet every minute and see how privatized it is today. Remember when news articles were free and not relegated to a 70 character limit? Remember when we could flex our basic html coding muscles on social media platforms, update free blogs, create open sourced wiki pages, and get cheap domain name registrations without being forced to buy a system that doesn’t even give you access to the backend? Now if you want to create something, internet spaces are expensive and physical spaces are prohibitively so. So what can we do?

Many of the web building platforms and content management systems on the internet at this point in time don't feel as inclusive as they used to be - and they've gotten more expensive. I don't feel like I am able to truly express myself when I use wordpress or godaddy or squarespace or wix or any of the other privatized platforms that we have today on the internet. I don't feel like any of it conveys all that I have to say. Forget about me. All that **we** have to say. So we’re going back to the basics. <b>HTML basics</b>, that is. Remember [Hamster Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEH2fk0ONag) ?

 The mission of this livejournal of the year 2020 is to explore Github, learn more coding, and create a website that is fun like what you'd find on the <b>World Wide Web</b> in 1999!
